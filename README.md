## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To run this tool locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)baker-ian/dictionary-CLI.git
    cd <YOUR_REPO_NAME>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # On Windows
    py -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

All commands are run from the project's root directory using the `python -m src.main` command.

### Get a Definition
```bash
python -m src.main define <word>
```
**Example**:
```bash
$ python -m src.main define hello

--- hello (exclamation) ---
  1. used as a greeting or to begin a phone conversation.

--- hello (noun) ---
  1. an utterance of 'hello'; a greeting.

--- hello (verb) ---
  1. say or shout 'hello'.
```

### Get Phonetics
```bash
python -m src.main phonetic <word>
```
**Example**
```bash
$ python -m src.main phonetic hello
Phonetic: h…ôÀàl…ô ä
Audio: [https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20200429/hello--_gb_1.mp3](https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20200429/hello--_gb_1.mp3)
```

### Get Word Origin
```bash
python -m src.main origin <word>
```
**Example**
```bash
$ python -m src.main origin hello

```

### Error: Word Not Found
```bash
$ python -m src.main define asdfasdf

```

## üß™ Testing
This project uses pytest and unittest.mock to ensure reliability. The test suite includes full mocking for all API calls, meaning it runs without needing an internet connection.

To run the tests locally:

1. Make sure you've installed dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt).

2. Run pytest from the root directory:
```bash
pytest
```
